# Netflix-Subscriptions-Forecasting
This project provides a Python implementation for forecasting Netflix quarterly subscriptions using time series analysis with ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). It includes data visualization with Plotly, quarterly and yearly growth rate analysis, and predictions for future subscription counts.
This repository contains Python code for forecasting Netflix quarterly subscriptions using time series analysis with ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and visualization with Plotly.

**Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly statsmodels
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-subscriptions-forecasting.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd netflix-subscriptions-forecasting
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to analyze and visualize Netflix subscriptions data.
Files
Netflix-Subscriptions.csv: CSV file containing Netflix quarterly subscriptions data.
Netflix_Subscriptions_Forecasting.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the code for forecasting and visualization.
readme.md: Documentation file providing information about the project.
Steps
Data Loading and Exploration:

Load Netflix subscriptions data from Netflix-Subscriptions.csv.
Explore the data and visualize quarterly subscriptions growth.
Quarterly Growth Rate Visualization:

Calculate and visualize the quarterly growth rate of Netflix subscriptions using a bar graph.
Color bars green for positive growth and red for negative growth.
Yearly Growth Rate Visualization:

Calculate and visualize the yearly growth rate of Netflix subscriptions using a bar graph.
Color bars green for positive growth and red for negative growth.
Time Series Analysis with ARIMA:

Use ARIMA to analyze the time series data.
Plot autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) to determine model parameters.
ARIMA Model Fitting and Prediction:

Fit an ARIMA model with determined parameters.
Generate predictions for future steps (default: 5 steps) and visualize the results alongside the original data.
